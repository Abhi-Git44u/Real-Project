Air pollution has become one of the most critical environmental and public health challenges in modern times. This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data across India to uncover pollution patterns, identify high-risk regions, and highlight the impact of major pollutants.

The dashboard transforms raw AQI data into actionable insights for better understanding environmental conditions and public health risks.






❗ Why Air Quality Is a Serious Cause of Concern

Poor air quality directly affects human health, climate, and overall quality of life. Prolonged exposure to polluted air can lead to severe health complications and long-term environmental damage.

Key concerns highlighted by this project:

🫁 Health Risks: High AQI levels are linked to respiratory diseases, asthma, lung infections, heart conditions, and reduced life expectancy.

🏙️ Urban Impact: Major cities and industrial regions frequently fall under Poor and Unhealthy AQI categories, making daily outdoor activities risky.

🧪 Toxic Pollutants: Fine particulate matter like PM2.5 and PM10 penetrates deep into the lungs and bloodstream, causing irreversible health damage.

📈 Rising Trends: Seasonal spikes and monthly AQI fluctuations indicate worsening air quality during specific periods.

👶 Vulnerable Populations: Children, elderly people, and individuals with pre-existing conditions are most affected by high pollution levels.

This analysis emphasizes the urgent need for data-driven awareness, monitoring, and policy interventions to mitigate air pollution risks.
